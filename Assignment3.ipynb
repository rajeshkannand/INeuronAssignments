    "1. Why are functions advantageous to have in your programs?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer\n",
    "\n",
    "A function is like a mini-program within a program. This allows us to reduce a complicated program into smaller, more manageable chunks, \n",
    "which reduces the overall complexity of our program\n",
    "\n",
    "Reusable - Once a function is written, it can be called multiple times from within the program.\n",
    "This avoids duplicated code\n",
    "\n",
    "Testing - Functions are self-contained, once we’ve tested a function to ensure it works,\n",
    "we don’t need to test it again unless we change\n",
    "\n",
    "Extensibility - When we need to extend our program to handle a case it didn’t handle before, functions allow us to make the change in one place and \n",
    "have that change take effect every time the function is called."
